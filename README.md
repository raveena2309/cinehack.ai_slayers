## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- 🧠 **Machine Learning / Deep Learning (ML/DL)**  
- 💬 **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
- 🎧 **Audio, Image & Video Processing**  
- ⚙️ **Gradio & Streamlit** (for interactive demos)  
- 🌐 **Next.js + Tailwind CSS** (for UI prototype)

## ⚙️ Limitations  

For demonstration purposes, the system currently uses **free API keys**, **bearer tokens**, and **Streamlit dashboards**.  
While the setup is fully functional, certain **usage limits** are applied to maintain demo stability and scalability.  

> Example: The image classifier is restricted to analyzing only the **most recent 20 images** from X (Twitter).  
> These constraints exist solely for **resource management and fair demo access**.
